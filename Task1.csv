Norton Genie,Mark Bailey,Every app has room for improvement but if the app is legit then it does flag tons of potential scams and decerns link concerns.Auto technology is a difficult thing to develop and where dr. web appears to be missing a key it seems to be patching this one.It is a mutual responsibility of each network and even the free version to guard in some was which is the point of the original root ai system.Web is missing the root on this life license perhaps an error in power tethering.,3

Norton Genie,Dylan Pereira,Norton is the biggest scammer. DO not give your details to them. Especially credit card details. They take your card details and keep charging you. There is no way to remove them from charging my card. I have been charged for years and they keep doing it. This used to be a good company but now they are just scammers and thieves. DO NOT USE. DO NOT TRUST YOUR DATA TO THIS COMPANY. THEY WILL SELL TO MAKE MONEY. UNETHICAL COMPANY!,1

It used to be smart this app now you take a picture of something that you want to know if it's fraud or not, it gives you information that you didn't even ask it to give you. It's like they made it dumber in the past 6 months. Why would they do that. Why make something worse that was doing fine. Don't use this it's useless. Just like Google's AI app that's a joke too.

Norton Genie,Neil Offiler,"I just received one of the usual failed to deliver your parcel emails. This one looked more realistic than normal, I wasn't expecting a parcel so assumed it was a scam, but with birthdays coming up in the house wasn't 100 percent sure. Norton genie soon told me as I expected that it was a scam. Great work. It is a little awkward coping as much text from the email as you can. so like some others have mentioned it would be handy if you could just forward the entire email to a genie address.",5

I would say that is less than 1 minute we'll spent, for the piece of mind it gives. Also it's free to use, so that's a bonus.",5

Norton Genie,chrystal willis castro,3 WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS APP Simple. Efficent. Free. I cant help but to feel like a ninja everytime i use this amazing app! The fact that this app has given me the ability to leave emotion out the equation when deciding if a text or emil has been created and sent by a scammer/spyware/malware is priceless. You can never go wrong having this app on your team while trying to protect whats most valuable to us all and thats our privacy.,5
Norton Genie,Carl ‚ÄúBic‚Äù Bickford,"So far the app does what it says it can do. It seems useful enough, and I find the subject info to be somewhat interesting. I have even done some research of my own to corroborate Norton Genie's final conclusion on some questionable content, and it hasn't been wrong yet... as far as I can tell. But in my opinion (as cliche as it is) ""Better safe than sorry,"" just like my mama always saidüòâ",5

Norton Genie,Steve W,"Worth having - even as a second opinion. I'm generally dubious of most texts from unknown sources (especially those wanting CC details such as my latest ""Coles"" redeem points one) and this has picked up a few ""it's a straight out scam"" message. In any case, I just use it as a double check as I have a certain company (bona fide) who should know better but insist on include external links in their messages.",5
Norton Genie,TwelveThirtyTwo,used a few images as test runs some I knew were scams and legit and it was spot on and the ones it's not sure on it gives you advice for example oztix to reach out to them and confirm the legitimacy of the emails and it just worked if you have emails like you've won 3.000 or so with bold and red letters most likely scams and this app analysed them correctly it's not a bad option to use if your not sure or need some peace of mind,5
Norton Genie,Christopher Fee,"The app and its functions are great... even amazing. But every time I'm in the middle of completing a text message scan, it either automatically ends the session halfway through or at the very end when I'm trying to ask it more about the message. It wouldn't be so bad if I could go back to where I left off and finish what I stated, but so far, i cant. It makes me feel even more uneasy about the messages than I was before because my questions go unanswered probably a very easy bug to fix DEV's!",3

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,"So far, no complaints. If you have your phone locked down, like Fort Knox, like I do, it can get a little tedious putting your code in for every time you open your app. Really had to play with the settings to get it just right. Also went with the VPN add-on as well. It's not a bad combination. I wish it could do URL and email address lookups on the fly for emails you aren't sure of, though. Reverse number lookup would be a nice touch as well. Would recommend",4

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,Very rough start. I downloaded the full premium version and within a week I got hacked for the first time ever.

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,Why does a mobile security device use tracking I discovered that Bitdefender is bundled with Google and Adobe tracking.

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,I am a fan of the Bitdefender products. I use the Total Antivirus for personal and professional devices and recommend it to customers. This product fits the bill of what I was looking for. I do not use their VPN and have gone with NordVPN for that. Never been a fan of one-stop-shopping for security applications and services. Nothing to do with their service.,5
Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,The defender has some pretty good features that I've wanted for a long time now like scanning email and text messages for scam emails that you get scam alerts every antivirus should have some kind of integration of that in their apps,5
Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,Great Internet security,5
Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,Bitdefender is by far the best security provider on the web. I've been using it for several years now and I strongly recommend it.,5

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,"Neutral vote from past experiences on these apps. I've purchased and was still hacked.

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,"Buggy and unreliable at times. Think I'll move back to Norton for the reliability. The value is great, the App Lock function only works half the time, all Anti-theft features often don't work - doesn't locate device, just saying it is working on it and will advise later, as with the other Anti-theft features, Web Protection occasionally & randomly turns itself off. VPN seems pretty good. Lots of good reviews on the web so thought I'd check this security program out but have felt a bit let down.",3

Bitdefender Mobile Security,A Google user,"So, the way I see it, Bitdefender's mobile AV is pretty decent, I think, at what they do, and it isn't as overly heavy on system resources as their Windows version(s). However, Mobile Security for Android is supposed to be part of the Windows Total Security package, yet Bitdefender allows about half of the time (or maybe a little less) for trial than it does for its Total Security package. So, well I'm still evaluating the windows version, I'll be switching to ESET for my mobile security.",3

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"the app describes what it performs however the bad actor stops the install because of knowledge base information he is not aware of the capibility strength functions from the malious end user abusing my experience without the play , Google cloud platform firebase and Android developers and yet these Google services sympathize the bad actors. Since the end user backed by admin sdk that Google provided generates web pages without any knowledge omits the . html resource file with black background",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Hate it that I was forced to update. The latest update crashes a lot and takes longer to scan up to half an hour, which wasn't an issue with the old version.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"After the latest update, previous option for higher grade security for pay or basic services for free has now been erased and is apparently demanding money to use. Makes it useless for my purposes, especially as the thing seems to randomly shut down on it's own whim rather then stay on when I turn it on, so goodbye.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Excellent Antivirus App,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,UNWANTED/UNNECRSSARY APPLICATION: It is something forced to my device that I neither requested or have an interest in and it is interferring. It is a privacy violator. It needs removed from the update list completely. Take this junk off of this and every version of android. This relates to that mess with AT&T sell off like BlackBerry did with now dedunct TCM.,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Awesome security application,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Sorry to hear that the basic/free version is completely going away. Would be nice if they offered free AND subscription based version. While it is understandable that a company wants to grow/expand, I agree with other users, that we should still be able to access the free version until it is discontinued. If putting up the subscription page & not being do anything in the free version is your way of communicating the free is now truly gone, this is a poor way to communicate it.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Keeps me safe !!! Thank You,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Hate this for a year, and it works great, but now it's behind a paywall, no thanks",1

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Refund my account immediately first of all I deleted the app & it wouldn't stay gone was during the trial period and the I got locked out this email have updated it and everything had I wanted to use it in irder for it work ""properly "" which bring me to the reason why I didn't want to buy the subscript. It slows ur phone doesn't allow u to use certain apps makes the phone freeze up I get better results with app services that are free and r much easier to navigate also",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"No pre-renewal reminder or notification... Response from F-Secure misses the mark since the subscription is annual. So customers get screwed for a whole year payment without notification. Also noted, they have no intention to notify of renewals. Beware!",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"When you cancel, you should be refunded . I canceled my account before the took the money . Not happy.",3
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Reviews,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,One of the worst apps ever,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Update, ok fine and dandy that your doing away with the free version. But please let us clear the pop-up until the free version is discontinued. This issue alone will keep me from paying for your subscription. I have used lookout for years. I love the app until now. After installing on my new phone all I get when opening the app is a pop-up wanting me to sign up for a 14 day trial. There is no way I can clear this pop-up to get back to the app.",1

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Excellent!,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"The VPN would cause me to not be able to connect to my home security system and it caused several other problems on a regular occasion. I just cancelled my subscription because of the home security problem. Seems useless and wasn't worth the money. The ""security scans"" were haphazard and the only time it was ever useful was to block malicious websites but I typically avoid those kinds of websites anyway. I definitely do NOT recommend this.",1

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Exactly as others note: with the merger, this product is now dead. T-mobile used to include premium services, which is no longer honored by Lookout Life. The app is pre-installed, but is useless unless you subscribe to premium and pay monthly or yearly. No option to bypass the sales pitch and subscription screen. Uninstalling from my devices today and will use a competitor or the mobile security offered by my desktop AV provider.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Lost 2 stars for the nag screen. To access the app now, open the app and leave the nag screen open and open the app again. Then the regular GUI is available. EVERY TIME !",3

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"I had this at 5 stars and even made a video on my channel about its features. But now, it has an ad that I cannot bypass where it wants you to buy a yearly subscription. Not cool to force it like that. It's been like this for months. I didnt give 1 star because it still runs and scans. I just can't view anything but that ad. I'm uninstalling lookout once I find a different mobile security app",2

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"* Update 9/2024 I switched phones & when I tried to log in, it said I needed to pay for the service. That's unfortunate becauseI loved this app. Great app! Keeps my phone protected and running quick!",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Please fix your mobile app.  When I open the app, the ad about purchasing Identity Monitoring feature literally takes up the whole screen, with no way to bypass it.  It obscures the regular lookout screen behind it. I can't get to the regular menu screen because of the ad window literally blocking it.  It's like you're trying to force users to purchase the Identify Monitoring feature.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Only 2 stars because Premium is supposed to send a picture when the phone is turned off, but it doesn't if you have an android!",2

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Wish it didn't cost so much.,3
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Works great on my phone , but stopped working on my Chromebook. Very frustrating, when I'm paying for the premium service. Will start looking at other services that will actuallky work with both my phone and Chromebook. The problem started when Lookout became Lookout Life. On Chromebook the app keeps crashing. This is the first problem I've had since I began using it in 2012. Not worth $100 a year, for all the premium features.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,The app works great but it won't allow me to join beta because it is associated with my husband's Karl's account. He died 2 1/2 years ago and has no phone or any email anymore. Please delete his account.,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I've used this app for years ..successfully..went to make sure it worked on my replacement phone and find out I can't use it all..I get some premium screen upgrade garbage..I had already paid to have it do what I need...now I need to contact my family members so they can check theirs and we can all find a new provider.. this sucks for a program that worked good for the everyday day guyüò† if good give 0 stars I would now,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I paid to renew my service and it's still not working yet this is BS,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,It won't let me use the app as it is stuck on the subscription page. What gives?,2
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"This is an outstanding security application with a highly effective malware detection engine. I commend the developers for their excellent work. However, I am experiencing an issue where the app is being automatically terminated, requiring me to manually reopen it to run in the background. Aside from this, the app performs exceptionally well. Thank you to the development team for their efforts",5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Only the best !!!,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Used to be good. Just started to nag for 3 month trial followed by $60 per year to keep what was a defeatured free app. Uninstalled. I already have much better paid for apps for security. Don't need this underwhelming app and certainly don't need to pay $60 a year for it.,2
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I used this app since my first phone and loved it. Now it just wants to force me to a premium trial and there is no way to use the free version. I either accept the trial or the app closes. Very disappointing.,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I had this on my old phone liked it a lot now I put it on my new phone log in to my account and now they want to do free trial and then pay for it what's up with that . I had just the basic now they trying to make me up grade to premium,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"A popup prevented me from accessing the service I had been paying for for years.

I'll do it again, but I still believe: DO NOT DOWNLOAD",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I cannot use this app. It's supposed to be free but the Free Trial window pops up and I can't access it to run it,3
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Installed on replacement android and now wants me to sign up for paid service. No more free version anymore. Too bad,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"This is a virus app or something. Won't unistall, i never installed it to begin with, and this tablet is freshly factory reset and used for light gaming.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I've been a customer since 2011 and I'm extremely satisfied with the protection I receive.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"I have this app for many years and it was great. For some reason when I reinstalled it on the same android v11 phone it presents me with the premium upgrade screen and doesn't allow to manage the app. Clear cash, delete data and reinstall don't help. Very frustrating! Probably it is my time to move to another security app.",2
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,When I try to open my Lookout Life app it immediately directs me to premium upgrade page and will not allow me to view my regular Lookout Life app. It's not even giving me an option to choose if I want it or not. It's very annoying. Please fix.,3
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Why are you trying to charge me for an app that I already paid for on T-Mobile? You won't let me go past the sign up for free trial page. I am not paying for something that I have already paid for. I'm talking to T-Mobile to get this situated & fixed because this is ridiculous. Lookout used to be a great app & that is why I was willing to pay for it through T-Mobile. I knew that they WERE worth it. This is some junk and I'm getting rid of it.,1

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,App is useless now unless you pay the subscription fee,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"This 4 star rating is because of past experiences. I've been using Lookout for years now and have enjoyed it. But over the past month or so I keep getting notifications about Look Out Life keeps stopping. I've had no problems with this app on my chromebook until now, at which point my laptop is unprotected. Since it's not working, I don't have the VPN I was using either. Maybe the next update will fix the problem, I don't know. I see F-Secure has their own stuff on here, maybe that's worth it.",4

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"This app came with my Sprint LG V40 ThinQ.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Not as useful since it was acquired by F-Secure.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"I have been a Premium Subscriber of Lookout for a long, long time.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Great for many years, now garbage. Lookout always had a free basic plan with the option to go to a Premium version for a fee. Then they merged with another company and now they don't give you the option anymore, you either upgrade to Premium or you can't use the app and from what I read even after you sign up, still can't use the app. Hope the merger was good to the original company, because the new company trashed the Lookout name and product for a money grab that isn't working.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"As many people point out, you can't even access the interface without signing up for the free trial. This is the WORST development of any product I've used - Greed run rampant. If you can't support a free version, don't offer this junk. The app also randomly stops now, I suspect just to force users to the impassable ""buy"" screen. I have to trust that it's actually doing anything until I find a good alternative. I'd say ""Lookout"" for this shoddy outfit and avoid any of their products.",1

Only way out of this screen is to kill the app completely. Tried again and same thing. I hate apps that are modeled this way. Only sub-par apps do this because their software is garbage and they know you won't pay once you use it. It's a real shame to see Lookout resorting to these tactics. How the mighty have fallen.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Before my new phone I gave this app 5 stars. That was before I got a new phone and they want me to pay for the app. I called customer service at T mobile and said it was always free. They said that was with my old plan I have a new plan and it's not included. After talking with a supervisor it was supposed to let me login. I did and when I went back I got the trial page again and can't get past it. I have uninstalled and am looking for something new,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Paid for app. and can't use it. Paid for the subscription and get nothing. Tried to find a way to contact someone and again nothing. I guess I'm out $59.00 dollars.,1

No mattter what I did the screen wouldn't go away. Lookout was installed on my phone for years but after the free-trial nonsense, and forced subscription, I opted to delete the app and look for another one.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Lacks clear usage info,3
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Been a premium paid user since 2012! Very happy with the protections offered. The change to Lookout Life has a snag, in that a splash screen forces a 14 day premium trial. I dug through old emails to locate an email address, since no other option available. Got a response email within 24 hours with steps to activate new Lookout Life with my premium account. They need to fix that for premium paid members. IT is awesome protection for your devices! I have used on note 2,3,9,10, Tab S6 and Fold3!",5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"After  a very frustrating & fruitless week of TRYING   to get support from Lookout, constant repeating of the same requests for information that I have already supplied, always from a different person, having to constantly chase them up. I am now cancelling  my subscription. Paid for Premium January 11th , stopped working March 18th. Have sent enough proof of payment but still no reinstatement. Plus no idea what the GPA is?

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Can't even look at the app without paid subscription.,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"They are ripping off Tmobile. Tmobile is paying for their customers, $9.94 to get this app for FREE!! Now all off a sudden, despite Tmobile paying for it, Lookout now wants me to sign up and pay for it myself!! Called Tmobile and turned Lookout in. Also told them Lookout wants $5.00 a month, so why are they paying $5.00 dollars a month more?? Have a strong feeling Tmobile will be going after Lookout. Also they have McAfee FOR FREE, Which does the same as Lookout including $1,000.000.00!!",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I'm very disappointed in this new version. I've used the basic app since the beginning. Now it tries to force you into a paid subscription. I'm forced to uninstall this. Goodbye.,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"Why are we being forced to use the premium version? Why not another option? Free is ok, pro would be nice and then premium.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Good,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Unable to get away from the subscription page. If I want to upgrade I will. By being unable to bypass the page is crazy and I am seriously thinking of deleting the app from my phone. There are other mobile security apps out there and I am seriously considering going to one of those. PROVIDE a way to bypass the upgrade page (vja an x or something) to get away from the upgrade page and get to the actual lookout page. Stop attempting to take a choice from people and forcing them to spend money.,1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"I lost access to my Google account, and therefore also had to set up a new Lookout Premium account. Fortunately I had experience from years ago with getting assistance from Lookout's support people, because finding their contact information is very challenging. I was assisted by three representatives, over a few days' time, with my request to have payment for the previous account credited. They were very responsive. I'm concerned, however, to read in user comments about recent problems.",4
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"I have been using this app for years. Now I'm forced to do the trial premium. There's no way to get around it. I won't be using it, period. Before this, I would have given 5 stars, but now I don't want to give any stars.",1
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Will not let you use unless you sign up free trial sorry no,1

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,"After many years of trusting Lookout for free, and after a new company took over with high disappointment I am obliged to engage in a free trial and then be charged if you continue. They in an ""aggressive"" manner don't let you even have the free trial without entering all your info plus payment method; you can't leave the screen. This is unbelievable.

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,Five stars for the deviousness of these virus writers ... all the good reviews say I have been using this software for years the developer clearly bought Bots to spam good good reviews too bad they were lazy and didn't write reviews that seems to be written by more than one person. there is no uninstall option suggesting either a cell phone provider has installed it or more likely it's a virus written by the Chinese or Russians looks like I'll have to wipe my device,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I Love Lookout Life It's Good,5
Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I will be following along with everyone else and saying goodbye to this app. I have used Lookout for 15+ years. It has helped in finding a many stolen/lost phones over the years. I have even swore by this app and recommended to over 100+ people. Not anymore! I got a new phone and when you open the app it tells you/forces you to try a 14 day trail and then pat after that. You can NOT get past that screen. Therefore you can no longer use it on a free basic term. To bad! BYE-BYE,1

Lookout Life - Mobile Security,A Google user,I'm sorry you're app isn't working right. It is like you have been hacked or you are trying to tell us your app isn't free .
